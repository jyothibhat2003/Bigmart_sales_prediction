# Bigmart_sales_prediction
This project predicts product sales at BigMart outlets using machine learning. It uses historical data, cleans and processes it, and trains an XGBoost model to forecast sales. A Streamlit web app allows users to input product details and get predicted sales instantly. The model and encoders are saved using Pickle for fast deployment.
